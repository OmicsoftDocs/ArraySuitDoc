### Introduction
Heatmap showing Gene Expression ratio (Sample vs Universal Human Reference) for group (e.g. Tumor Type) for multiple genes.

In the demo screenshot, it's a Heatmap plot for pathway Extrinsic_to_Plasma_Membrane, with 13 genes in it, the X-axis is gene, while Y-axis is grouping (e.g. Tumor Type).
Expression data was generated on a two-color chip. Use the Sample Tab to further filter the data using any associated sample/subject meta data.
Use Specify Profile (Task tab) to change the grouping.

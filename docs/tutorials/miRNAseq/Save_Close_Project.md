# Save & Close Project

Go to the **File Menu | Save** to save your results.
Please refer to the MicroArray tutorial for more details on the *Audit Trial*,
which records all the analysis steps in the form of Omic script.

Congratulations! You are done with the analysis. You can reopen this project later on to get back to the same state as you saved. This includes all views, filters, analyses, etc.

This tutorial represents just a piece of what Array Studio is capable of.
Feel free to try different options in the Task tab or the NGS menu to get a feel for what Array Studio can do. For additional information, don't hesitate to contact Omicsoft's support team (omicsoft.support@qiagen.com).

**Thank you for using Array Studio.**

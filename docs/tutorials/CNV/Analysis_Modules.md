# Analysis Modules

Besides visualization and summarization, Array Studio includes a number of different association analysis modules. However, for this tutorial, we will not use these modules, as the sample data does not fit with that type of analysis.

*Array Studio* includes modules for analyzing CNV data association under the *CNV Menu* as shown below. These include **General Linear Model**, **Quantitative Trait**, **Categorical Trait**, **Survival Trait**, and **Repeated Measure Trait** analysis modules. If user has quantitative trait, categorical trait, survival trait or repeated measure trait in the experiment, they can use appropriate modules for the association analysis.

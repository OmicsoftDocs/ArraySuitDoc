# Delete your GeneticsLand

You may wish to keep the Land you have created for this tutorial for additional training and testing. The datasets that were published were relatively small and will not consume much disk space on the server. When you are done with your Land and want to delete it, from the **Tools** menu, select **Delete Land**

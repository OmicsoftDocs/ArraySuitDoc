# Introduction

## Overview

Samples and sample sets are registered and managed on the server, along with their corresponding meta data. An Omic sample is associated with one or more raw data files, while an NGS sample can be associated with 1-2 raw data file(s), a BAM file, and/or a VCF file. A sample set is a collection of samples and usually is associated with an experiment. Samples and samplesets are the basic elements for pipelines and visualizations. Users can organize and search samples/samplesets by any meta data field, and create new sample sets by any criteria.

## Test Dataset

This tutorial will cover sample and sampleset registration, and integration to pipeline using a mock dataset. You can download the same tutorial dataset and registration text files on our website:

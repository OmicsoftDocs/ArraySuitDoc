# Server Sample Management

Samples and sample sets are registered and managed on the server, along with their corresponding meta data.
An -Omic sample is associated with one or more raw data files, while an NGS sample can be associated with 1-2 raw data file(s), a BAM file, and/or a VCF file. A sample set is a collection of samples and usually is associated with an experiment. Samples and samplesets are the basic element for pipelines and visualizations. Users can organize and search samples/samplesets by any meta data field, and create new sample sets by any criteria.

Please read more details in the **Sample Management** tutorial.

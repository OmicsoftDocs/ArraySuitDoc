# Create Server Project

Array Studio provides an integrated environment for analyzing and visualizing high dimensional data. It is convenient in organizing and visualizing data with Solution Explorer, which organizes data/results as projects. User can create a local project which uses the local computer power to do analysis, or create a server project which will run all analyses in Array Server. In this tutorial, we are using server projects. If user don’t have Array Server installed, user can run the tutorial as a local project and analysis steps are almost the same as described in this tutorial.

!!! note
    If user is using local project to analyze the SingleCell data in this tutorial, please refer to our tutorial for “RNA-Seq Analysis” about creating ArrayStudio local Project: [Create Projects](../RNASeq/CreateArray_Studio_Project.md).

In order to analyze the data in server project, user should firstly connect to a server and upload the fastq files if they are not accessible on server folder: [Connect to Server and Upload Files](../ServerAnalysisBasics/Connecting_to_a_Server_and_Uploading_Files.md)

Then user can create a server project following analysis: [Create Server Project](../ServerAnalysisBasics/Creating_and_Publishing_a_Server_Project.md)  for

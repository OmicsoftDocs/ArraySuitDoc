# Virtual Land

Virtual Land is a virtual link between multiple Array Lands. By creating a virtual land, users can search and compare across multiple lands.

## Create Virtual Land

To create a virtual land, go to **Tools | Create Virtual Land**. Please note that the default server setting only allows administrators to be able to create virtual land.

## Cross Land Search

Open a virtual land and search for one or multiple genes. The search includes data and samples from all Array Lands in this virtual land.

There is a column "Source Land" automatically added to the virtual land when it is created.

Data will be able to compare between different Array Lands by **Specify Multiple Profile Columns** and add **SourceLand** in.

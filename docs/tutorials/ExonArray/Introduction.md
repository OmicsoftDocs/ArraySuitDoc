# Introduction

## Array studio

*Array Studio* provides an integrated environment for analyzing and visualizing high dimensional data.
It is convenient for organizing and visualizing data with its *Solution Explorer*, which organizes each project into *Data, QC, Table, List, Cluster, Text, Attachments* and other categories.
Multiple projects can be opened simultaneously in the *Solution Explorer*, and data can be shared among projects.
Each view is controlled by a *View Controller*, which performs view customization, applies filtering, and displays legends.
Furthermore, its interactive visualization technique provides the details of data with the *Details Window* and *Web Details On-Demand*.

It is highly recommended that the user complete the prerequisite for this tutorial: MicroArray Tutorial,
which is a good introduction to installation, basic usage, data structure and standard visualization in Array Studio.

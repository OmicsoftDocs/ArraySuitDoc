# Custom Query

## Custom Query in Land Portal Explore

Omicsoft Land users can add **Custom Query** in Land to categorize the samples by, for example, certain gene's mutation status, copy number status, fusion status, etc. The customized query can be used in many ways, such as filter, grouping factor, etc.

This tutorial is mainly based on CCLE_B37 Land Portal. Please refer to the OncoLand Whitepaper, available through the Help menu item, for descriptions of all available land portals within Land Portal.

## CNV Log2 Ratio

Omicsoft Land users can add CNV Call, CNV Log2 Ratio, DNA Somatic Mutation, and RNA-Seq Expression queries by clicking Custom icon in Land Portal.

Four new filters will be available after users inputted the custom query:

Once the new Queries are available, users can filter the samples by input thresholds or set up a range for each filter, by clicking **Three Dots Icon**, and input the thresholds.

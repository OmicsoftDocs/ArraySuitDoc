# Comparison Filters

All Samples, Comparisons, and Projects within OmicSoft Land's are associated with extensive metadata, which can be used to filter Land data to find the samples users are interested in. This page describes some filters that can be used to pare down to comparisons of interest. The most common comparison filters are shown here:

# Key Comparison Filters

The comparison metadata can come in different forms, numeric, categoric, and string.

## Fold Change Cutoff

Users can filter to comparisons in which a gene is differentially regulated by typing in fold changes, or using predefined filters:

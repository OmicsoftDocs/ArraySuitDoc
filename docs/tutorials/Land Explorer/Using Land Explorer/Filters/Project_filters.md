# Project Filters

There are a number of views in which users can apply filtering at the Project level using metadata attributed to the samples. The Land Explorer will display 10-15 (at most) of the most commonly used metadata for users to filter their samples. Additional filters can be added by the user to dig deeper into the data [Add Filters](../../Using Land Explorer/Filters/Filters.md#available-filters) This page will describe some of the key metadata that exists in the Land commonly used for filtering Projects.

## ProjectName

Easily filter to a project by entering the GSE or EMTAB accession number attributed to the project:

![ProjName_png](../../images/project_name.png)

## Disease

Users can easily identify projects by disease focus using the checkbox filter:

![ProjDisease_png](../../images/proj_disease.png)

## Therapeutic Area

For more general disease focus, the Therapeutic Area can used to identify a broader focus of studies:

![ProjTher_png](../../images/proj_therapeutic.png)

# Introduction

**Note to reader**: The tutorial pages are actively being written to describe the usage of the Land Explorer and the recent 2018Q1 release. Please check back for updates or e-mail support@omicsoft.com if you have specific questions not addressed here.

## Land Explorer

OmicSoft uses ArrayLand framework to deliver large amounts of clinica and "omic"-data to biologists with simplistic visualization. ***Land Explorer*** is the quickest way to explore OmicSoft Land data (OncoLand, DiseaseLand, GeneticsLand, and Internal Lands). Users of Array Studio may be familiar with the content provided within the Land Explorer framework. The streamlined web interface uses our most popular visualizations to help researchers and clinicians explore OmicSoft Lands.

Land Explorer is hosted on a Windows machine which connects to ArrayServer to provide access to rich visualization of Omic-data, directly in a user's web browser, meaning no extra software required. Land Explorer can used as a companion product to Omicsoft's ArraySuite (to use with internal Lands and OmicSoft Lands), or as a standalone product hosted by Qiagen/Omicsoft. Like ArraySuite, Land Explorer is fully customizable to meet the needs of its users.

These tutorial pages demonstrate the utility of Land Explorer, including a description of the many [views](./Land Views/Views.md) available, as well as the [general usage and customizations](./Using Land Explorer/LandExplorerInterface.md) of these views.

## Log in to Land Explorer

Once you connect to the **LandExplorer**, the default land chosen by the administrator (TCGA by default) will appear. Users can switch to other Lands by simply clicking **Select Land**:

The default **TCGA_B37 Land Explorer** view shows a histogram plot of samples grouped on the y-axis by Tumor Type, and colored on the x-axis by Sample Type. Other views are also available for users to query the sample data at a general level.

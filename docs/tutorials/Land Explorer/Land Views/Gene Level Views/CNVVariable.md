### Introduction
This view shows the Log2 Ratio (if a gene contains multiple segment, the most sigificant segment will be chosen) for the specified gene, organized by group (e.g. Tumor Type).

When visualizing more than one gene, each gene is show in its own plot.
X-axis shows Expression Ratio. Y-axis shows the group.
Use the Sample Tab to further filter the data using any associated sample/subject meta data. Use Specify Profile (Task tab) to change the grouping.
Use Specify Split Column (Task tab) to change the automatic coloring.
Show on-the-fly p-value, indicating if the Log2 Ratio is significantly changed, of selected group (and split column) using Show Summary Information (Task Tab | Customize).

# Methylation views

DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that plays a regulatory role in multiple biological processes and diseases. In the Land Explorer, users can visualize methylation level of genes, at high resolution and in a large number of samples.

## Methylation Beta Value

This view shows methylation beta value, one chart for each probe, for the specified gene. Each dot on the plot represents an individual sample, and the plot is organized on the y-axis by the primary grouping (e.g. tumor type). The methylation value is shown on the x-axis:

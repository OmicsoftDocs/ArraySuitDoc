# CNV Summary

## Copy Number Summary View in Land Portal

![LandPortal_login_png](../../images/CNVSummary.png)

The summary view shows % of samples in a given group:
1. amplified or deleted of tumor vs normal if using log2ratio calls
2. having Amplification, Homozygous Deletion or other categories if using GISTIC calls


# CNV Variable

## Copy Number Variable View in Land Portal

![LandPortal_login_png](../../images/CNVVariable.png)

This view shows the Log2 Ratio (if a gene contains multiple segments, the most significant segment will be chosen) for the specified gene, organized by group (e.g. Tumor Type).

When visualizing more than one gene, each gene is shown in its own plot.
X-axis shows copy number (Log2) Ratio. Y-axis shows the group.
Use the Sample Tab to further filter the data using any associated sample/subject meta data.

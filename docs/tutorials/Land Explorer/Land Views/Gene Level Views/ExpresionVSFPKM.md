# Expression vs. FPKM

## Expression Ration vs. Gene Expression (FPKM) View for genes in Land Portal

![LandPortal_login_png](../../images/ExpressionRationFPKM_Views.png)

This view shows a single chart, for each gene, comparing Gene Expression Ratio (Sample vs Universal Human Reference) vs Gene Expression (Log2(RPKM + 0.1)). A value of 0.1 has been added to every RPKM value in order to log the data and account for potential values of 0.

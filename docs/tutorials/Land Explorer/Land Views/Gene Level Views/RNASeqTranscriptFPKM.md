# RNA SEQ Quantification

## RNASeq Quantification Transcript FPKM View in Land Portal

![LandPortal_login_png](../../images/RNASeqTranscript.png)

This view shows the Transcript RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads) for the specified gene, organized by group (e.g. Tumor Type).


Each transcript is shown in a separate chart. When visualizing more than one gene, each gene/transcript is show in its own plot.
X-axis shows Transcript RPKM. Y-axis shows the group.
Use the Sample Tab to further filter the data using any associated sample/subject meta data. Use Specify Profile (Task tab) to change the grouping. Use Specify Split Column (Task tab) to change the automatic coloring. Show on-the-fly p-value, indicating if the Gene RPKM is significantly changed, of selected group (and split column) using Show Summary Information (Task Tab | Customize). Use the dropdown (1*1) to change how many charts are shown at once (i.e enter 2*3 to show 6 plots at once)"

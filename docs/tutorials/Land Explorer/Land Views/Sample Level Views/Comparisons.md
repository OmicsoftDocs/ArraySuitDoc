**Overview**

This view shows all pre-computed comparisons present in the Land. In TCGA land, this will typically be all Tumor vs Normal (where available) comparisons. In DiseaseLands and OncoGEO, this can refer to multiple comparison types (i.e. Disease vs. Normal, Treatment vs. Control, Response vs no response, pre-treatment vs post-treatment). In this view, users can quickly query the different comparisons available within the Land, based on the category shown on the x-axis.

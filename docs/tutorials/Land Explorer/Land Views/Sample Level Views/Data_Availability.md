# Data Availability

This view shows all sample information and "Omic"data available in the current Land. In TCGA land, this will typically show a table of all data available where each row represents one Tumor Type (ACC, BLCA, COAD, etc.), and each column shows -OmicData (CNV, DNA, MS, miRNA, etc.).

In DiseaseLands and OncoGEO, each row of the table would represent Disease Category (i.e. allergy, arthritis, autoimmune disease, benign neoplasm, etc.), each column would show -Omic data (i.e. Expression, Methylation, miRNA, RNA-seq, etc.). In this view, users can quickly check the sample category and the -Omic data available within the Land, based on the category shown on the rows and cols.

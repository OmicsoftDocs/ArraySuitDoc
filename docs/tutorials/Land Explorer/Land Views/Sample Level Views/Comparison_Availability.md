# Comparison Availability

This view shows all pre-computed comparisons present in the Land. In TCGA land, this will typically be all Tumor vs Normal (where available) comparisons. In 2018, the Omicsoft OncoLand team has added a number of comparisons to reflect the mutation status of genes represented in the [QIA-seq Cancer Panels](https://www.qiagen.com/us/shop/sample-technologies/dna/genomic-dna/qiaseq-targeted-dna-panels/#orderinginformation). In DiseaseLands and OncoGEO, this can refer to multiple comparison types (i.e. Disease vs. Normal, Treatment vs. Control, Response vs no response, pre-treatment vs post-treatment). In this view, users can quickly query the different comparisons available within the Land, based on the category shown on the x-axis.
